                        <h3>Solar activity, Cyclones and Earthquakes: What is the Connection? </h3>
                        <p>Seismologist B. Gutenberg found out through his research the astonishing parallelism between COSmophysical phenomenon (solar activity), MEteorological phenomena (barometric pressure, cyclones) and frequency of earthquakes (TEctonic phenomena). He published his results in 1927 opening the question what those CORrelations on a planetary scale are about. As of 1967, seismologist M. Bath from Seismological Institute in Sweden found out that global process in the earth’s interior connects earthquakes to each other over entire planet (referred as seismic global concept). Båth named it sympathetic behavior while examining two gigantic earthquakes which have occurred in 1964 (M9.2, Alaska) and 1965 (M8.7, Aleutian Isl). </p>

                        <h3>Principal concerns</h3>
                        <p>The crushing victory of the theoretical approach over the experimental approach lasted only until the theory was used to make experimentally verifiable predictions of the tectonic events. When attempts were made to verify such correlations to predict EQ researchers faced two principal questions: How do such electric (charge) global disturbances, coming from the Sun and covering whole globe, concentrate in such very small volumes of earthquakes foci? And how does the mechanical energy of huge cyclonic disturbance concentrate comparatively small volume of the earthquake focus?</p>
                        <p>Seismologists know how many earthquakes every minute are there... But seismometers have no capability of early detecting a strong earthquake within days, weeks and months before it occurs. It has been the goal of unsuccessful research for the past 130 years.</p>

                        <h3>The circuitry of  Currents in Solar system</h3>
                        <p>When space missions made the magnetosphere and interplanetary space accessible to physical instruments and as observational techniques advanced, it became obvious that space and, in particular, the Solar system is filled with the circuitry of currents. The conception of gigantic closed electrical circuits made it happen to calculate amplitude and phases of the solar cycle (Kuznetsov, 70's) and electric network model of solar wind interaction with Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere (Nobel prize laureate Alfven, the 70's). NASA's fleets of fifth THEMIS spacecraft, launched in February 2007, has made important discoveries about spectacular eruptions of Northern Lights and the source of their power. The mission's discoveries include giant magnetic ropes that connect Earth's upper atmosphere to the Sun and explosions in the outskirts of Earth's magnetic field. A 'magnetic rope' is a twisted bundle of magnetic fields organized much like the twisted hemp of mariner's rope.</p>

                        <p>The earth’s hydride core and the Sun contain protons which are atoms of hydrogen. V.I. Vernadsky, prominent Russian Academician, backed the model which decrypts that :</p>
                        <p>1) hydrogen are likely dissolved into iron during the Earth's evolution forming the light iron hydride (FeH4) core, and </p>
                        <p>2) protons (positive charges) escape from the earth’s hydride core and rise upwards closing up the hydrogen cycling to Earth’s surface separately from the cycling of water, and then give rise to proton upwelling phenomenon, which is the rising of low energy protons from ionosphere to magnetosphere. All tectonic processes occur in the tectonosphere due to the impulsive protons migration from the Earth’s core to the crust.</p>

                        <h3>Underground electric station Cosmetecor</h3>
                        <p>Historically, underground electric measurements can be traced back to classic telluric measurements, performed using long measurement lines, whose ends had lead electrodes buried in bore pits at a depth of some meters. Measuring line lengths varied from kilometers to tens of meters. Usually, a couple of measuring lines, extended along magnetic meridian and parallel, are used. Such "crosses" are being used till present time to measure magnetotelluric currents. The magnetotelluric station was successfully used in geophysical exploration, and there were unsuccessful attempts to use Magnetotelluric station for earthquake prediction.</p>
